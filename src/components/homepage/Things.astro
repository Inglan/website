        <p>
            I have built many websites for friends and community things, such as
            Hack Club YSWSes. I also build web apps to solve my problems, and
            for fun.

        <p>
            I run and maintain about 40 Docker containers in my homelab which
            are behind Traefik. I have also set up SSO to everything with
            authentik.

        <h2 class="text-2xl text-primary">Networking</h2>
        <p>
            I have set up VLANs in my home network for security and
            organization, and force my family to use username/password auth.
